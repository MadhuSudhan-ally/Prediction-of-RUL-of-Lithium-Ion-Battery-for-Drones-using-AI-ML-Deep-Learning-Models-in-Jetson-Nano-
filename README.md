# Prediction-of-RUL-of-Lithium-Ion-Battery-for-Drones-using-AI-ML-Deep-Learning-Models-in-Jetson-Nano-
An AI-based system that predicts the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of lithium-ion batteries in UAVs using CNN-LSTM deep learning. It processes sensor data to ensure safer, longer flights and is optimized for real-time edge deployment on NVIDIA Jetson Nano.

Overview

This project presents an AI-powered system to predict the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of lithium-ion batteries used in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The model uses deep learning (CNN + LSTM) architectures to analyze voltage, current, and temperature data and estimate how long a battery will continue to operate safely.
Optimized for real-time inference on NVIDIA Jetson Nano, this project enhances flight safety, efficiency, and battery maintenance.

üß† Key Features
